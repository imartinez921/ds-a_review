## Invert Binary Tree
- YOU MUST WORK ON THE ROOT NODE FIRST!
  - Wrap the root node in a queue and then start your queue loop
- Not sure how long I took because of this stupid stopwatch resetting ðŸ˜… 

## Balanced Brackets
-   25mins, but I couldn't troubleshoot my solution, which was failing
    -   BEWARE THE LOGIC OF && vs ||
-   If you .pop an empty array, it returns undefined
-   Be careful the punctuation inside the set-up for a for loop
